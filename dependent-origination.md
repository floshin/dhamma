# On Dependent Origination

kyklon_anarchon:
> the culture of renunciation [...] is not specific only to Buddhism. sense restraint is not specific only to Buddhism. morality is not specific only to Buddhism. phenomenological investigation of experience is not specific only to Buddhism. talk of a form of liberation is not specific only to Buddhism. whatever is liberatory about Buddhism (and this is the Buddha's main claim -- that what he was teaching is liberatory in a way other teachings are not) is, consequently, not about these shared aspects -- although these aspects might be important for understanding both the context of the suttas and their content. 

> the teaching specific to the Buddhas -- according to the Buddha's own description -- is *dependent origination*. understanding dependent origination is understanding the dhamma.
> understanding experience in terms of dependent origination instead of assuming it as self is the "originality" brought about by the Buddha.
