# Right View

In order to get an idea about right view, we consider what is meant with wrong view.

One part of it are the "perversions of perception". 

> There are these four perversions of perception, thought, and view:  
> (1) Taking impermanence as permanence.  
> (2) Taking suffering as happiness.  
> (3) Taking not-self as self.  
> (4) Taking ugliness as beauty.

> There are these four corrections of perception, thought, and view:  
> (1) Taking impermanence as impermanence.  
> (2) Taking suffering as suffering.  
> (3) Taking not-self as not-self.  
> (4) Taking ugliness as ugliness.
