# Right View

In order to get an idea about right view, we consider what is meant with wrong view.

One part of it are the "perversions of perception". 

> There are these four perversions of perception, thought, and view:  
> Taking impermanence as permanence.  
> Taking suffering as happiness.
> Taking not-self as self.  
> Taking ugliness as beauty.

> There are these four corrections of perception, thought, and view:  
> Taking impermanence as impermanence.  
> Taking suffering as suffering.  
> Taking not-self as not-self.  
> Taking ugliness as ugliness.
