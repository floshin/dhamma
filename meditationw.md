## Five Reflections

Anigha: If you want a practice that you can do regardless of where you stand on the path, it is the five reflections the Buddha universally encouraged to everyone:

> “There are five themes that should often be reflected upon (by everyone): (1) ‘I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.’ (2) ‘I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.’ (3) ‘I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.’ (4) ‘I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me.’ (5) ‘I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.’ —AN 5.57 (paraphrased)
