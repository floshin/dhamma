# On Non-Duality

> Vinoba: "To get involved in a 'dispute' about absolute monism, is to provide an unmistakable proof of dualism." (Random Reflections / Vichar Photi)

> Ishwar Harris: "Vinoba's conception of the Divine can be characterised as polymorphic monism. It suggests that the ultimate reality manifests itself in many ways. Therefore, no conception of the absolute, whether it be polytheistic, monistic, dualistic or theistic, can be separated from each other. Vinoba followed the Upanishadic dictum which states that 'Reality is one but the sages speak of it in many ways'."

> Vinoba explains that *Loka-sangraha* is the quality of uniting people, not to allow them to split up, to negate parochialism, partitioning and partiality at any cost. *Advaita* is reality and *Asambheda* is the method of realising the reality. 

> The peaceful make no enemies. (Buddha)
