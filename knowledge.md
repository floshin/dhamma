# Knowledge / Jnana/Jana

> Vinoba, paraphrased: "Even if we have knowledge of all sciences and combine them, yet we cannot comprehend the unfractionalised (akhanda) garment (vastra) of this cosmos through a second-hand knowledge of a coarse cloth placed together and made somehow into one." (Vinoba Bhave in the 21st Century)
