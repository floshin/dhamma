> Nyanamoli: Restraint cannot cause you pain; it can only uncover the underlying pain of the desire that is already there.



## If external restraint has been achieved

> Nyanamoli: If you’re not devaluing sensuality and are still holding on to it as a valuable thing, not seeing the danger in it, then you are still within its domain even if you’re not engaging in it.

> When you do keep the virtue, practice sense restraint and patient endurance, you have to do it with the attitude of: ‘I will do this infinitely, forever. it doesn’t matter how long this lasts, I will have to endure it forever, and I won’t act out of it.’

> You might have already endured more than enough for wisdom to arise. But wisdom will not arise because, overall, you’re not relinquishing the *value* of sensuality.

> It doesn’t matter what you do, or how much effort you’re putting in (...) if you have not, on the level of your views,
devalued sensuality *forever*.

> Through not understanding the danger of it — you are still within it.

> There will be no wisdom arising on account of whatever endurance you undergo, because you do so while still acting from the point of view that sensual pleasures are valuable.

> It doesn’t matter whether you’re a monk or a lay person: if you want to practice the Dhamma, practically speaking, most of the work comes down to drying your mind from sensuality, it doesn’t come down to finding the perfect technique or reading the exact sutta that will make you enlightened.
> The reason why you’re not enlightened even after you have read all the Suttas, is not because you haven’t read them enough or you haven’t thought about them enough — it’s because your sticks are not dry enough and your views are not relinquished.

### Discerning disown the body

> If you want to uproot the dependence on the pleasure of the sense objects, you have to uproot the dependence on the pleasure of this body: its agreeability and your assumption of ownership, which results from not seeing it peripherally as a thing which endures there on its own, with its own thirsts. This disowning of the body can only be done on the level
of that correct peripheral recognition of what the body is. 

> It cannot be done on the level of observing the body with your senses; because then you are not actually observing the body, you are observing the sense objects which *require* the body.

> An eye cannot see itself. (...) You need to discern the body not on the level of the senses, but on the level of the framework of the world of the sense objects, and that is what will fully purify the relationship between you and the ‘indirect’ body that appears peripherally while you are experiencing sense objects.

> For as long as there are sense objects, the body, as the unity of the
sense organs, is peripheral to that. It’s always the background to the
domain of the sense objects, and that’s where you need to recognize it.

> It’s about understanding the six-sense base, the body as that thing which is there, that needs to be tamed on that level
of the peripheral.

> The less you engage with sense objects that are pulling you, the more the pressure that the body exerts over you will diminish, and the clearer you will see it on that level which is revealed through sense-restraint.

> If you want to stop chasing sense pleasures, you need to start practising mindfulness of the body *correctly*. (...) Instead of watching the sensations of the body, recognize the *idea* (dhamma) of it, as a real thing existing concurrently to your direct attention. And you can only learn to see that idea correctly, if you have been sufficiently practising sense restraint, guarding the sense doors,
moderating your eating, watchful(ness) and dwelling in solitude.

> When you have been sufficiently withdrawn in this way, you can disown the pressure and pull of those individual organs and start to see them as five individual animals, like the simile that the Buddha gave in SN 35.247. You can genuinely see them as wild animals that
need training, whereas those who are not withdrawn from sense objects (...) are
very much identified with them. They don’t see their sense organ as an independent entity which basically has its own life, desires and needs, which they need to tame and control. Each time there is a pull from
a sense object, then *they* are the ones that are pulled by sense objects. They don’t see anything in between.

> When one knows and sees the eye as not-self, the underlying tendencies are uprooted. When one knows and sees forms
as not-self, the underlying tendencies are uprooted. When one knows and sees like this, the underlying tendencies are uprooted. – SN 35.56

You could as well translate it as: "as not mine". The idea of "self" that the Buddha radically rejects is the ownership of anything you regard as yourself, as coming from yourself or as belonging to yourself. He never speaks in abstract concepts, but always in practical ways, always looking at how X *relates* to Y, always taking the dependence into account, what is based on what, what results in what, what stems from what. 
Practically speaking, by identifying yourself with anything that one usually identifies with and regards as himself, belonging to himself, coming from himself, you consider all of this to be *yours*. In this way identity automatically becomes or *is* ownership. 

This buddhist rejection of self in the sense of the rejection of any kind of identity and ownership (of the body and mind), is no rejection and is not in conflict with the idea of the self in Vedanta, where body and mind are not confused with the self, but where as the self is regarded only that which remains when everything is taken away that one could own. 

The Atman of the Vedanta is just the other side of the same coin of Buddhas Anatta, it includes the same rejection, the same overcoming, just looked at it like in an inverted image.

#### Right Order vs. perverted/wrong order


> That is what is meant by ‘establishing the right order’: seeing what comes
first and stays there as first: body on the level of the peripheral. Not losing
that context, regardless of what else might happen with your attention.
So whatever you are attending to, whatever pressure there is—desire for
pleasure and so on—the order that is now determined by your knowledge
does not change; you still see that peripheral body as the basis for all of
this that is happening, and all you need to do is protect that order so that
there is no room to become underlain by greed, aversion, and delusion,
which is the perverted order.

> Lust, aversion, and distraction will completely fade because they have not been maintained through the perversion of the order. That’s why it is said that ‘sensuality is a perversion of perception,’ i.e. putting the sense objects first and everything else measured through that as second; and not seeing the body peripherally, the necessary basis for sense organs, as that which is first (structurally speaking). 

If in a buddhist context the words "right" and "wrong" are used, then never in a moralist sense, but always in a sense of real vs. unreal. Right is what is undistorted, revealed, uncovered, fully understood, right is actually seeing, understanding, perceiving reality as it is. Wrong is what is distorted, hidden, covered up; wrong is seeing, understanding, perceiving reality as it not actually is, taking it wrongly. There is no room for morality here. It is all about practice. 

Either you see that the snake is actually a rope and thus see it rightly or you mistake the rope as a snake, which is wrong, which is a failure, not a moral failure, but simply a misunderstanding, a misconception etc.

That is not only so in regard to right and wrong view or right and wrong order (of perception), but as well in regard to right livelihood and any other aspects of the noble eightfold path.

Right livelihood isn't right due to something morally good or wrong due to something morally bad, it is right because it isn't based on wrong assumptions, or wrong because it *is* based on wrong assumptions. The idea is that when someone is trading arms and profits of war, this isn't morally wrong and one doesn't have to change ones moral values; it is worse,  it is simply done based on a wrong perception of what is going on. It is not that one ought to stop when seeing things clearly, but that one would *automatically* stop if seeing things clearly or correctly. 

Short: Everything "wrong" is never wrong based on moral sin, but it is always based on a wrong understanding. And that is what every sin in the christian sense is just as well: There is neither need nor room for morality in it. Sin is based on a wrong, distorted, misguided understanding and wouldn't be possible based on a right view. It always rooted in ignorance. 

> Father, forgive them, for they don't *know* what they do.

But while we cannot judge others for what they don't know, for what they cannot clearly see, we ourselves of course have responsibility for our ignorance. Thus instead of taking any external action or avoid any action based on moral grounds, our highest priority, our "moral imperative", if there is such a thing, is always: Trying to clear our view, purify our understanding, taking the "Balken" away from our own eyes first before anything else. 

And if specific external actions or avoidances are necessary in order to develop such a view, in order to purify our understanding, then they are necessary in a technical way, not in a moral way, they are necessary in order to reach a particular goal and are to be judged on the basis of that goal, in the very same way as an acrobatics coach will tell his athletes that they do something wrong and not correctly, not because they did anything morally wrong, but just because they made a *technical* failure or a strategical failure that takes them away from their common goal. 

And in this way the precepts can be approached. They don't have to be approached from a moral perspective. They can be approached in an experimental way. Just as when a master craftsmen tells you: In order to get this result, you follow *this* technique and do it rigorously because otherwise it will not work out as intended, and then you trust him and follow his guidance and achieve that result, with no morality involved, in the same way you may trust a spiritual teacher or a book or the dhamma; they show you a path, that you are not obligated to walk. But you are open to consider their ideas and may decide that you want to try it, try walking that path towards that goal, maybe even just to see if they are right, which you only can know if following all of their instructions. 

Anything else would obviously be stupid, it would be like claiming a master baker is wrong and his teachings are non-sense without following his recipe and guidance or after doing it differently and changing things as you wish. Of course you will then not achieve the result. You have to commit and trust the process. 

So it is with the Dhamma and any religion. If you want to reach the goal the path is leading to, then it would be wise to follow it and it would be stupid not to. And it would be "wrong" to leave it in such a case, because it would lead you into the wrong direction, based on your goal.
