> Nyanamoli: Restraint cannot cause you pain; it can only uncover the underlying pain of the desire that is already there.



## If external restraint has been achieved

> Nyanamoli: If you’re not devaluing sensuality and are still holding on to it as a valuable thing, not seeing the danger in it, then you are still within its domain even if you’re not engaging in it.

> When you do keep the virtue, practice sense restraint and patient endurance, you have to do it with the attitude of: ‘I will do this infinitely, forever. it doesn’t matter how long this lasts, I will have to endure it forever, and I won’t act out of it.’

> You might have already endured more than enough for wisdom to arise. But wisdom will not arise because, overall, you’re not relinquishing the *value* of sensuality.

> It doesn’t matter what you do, or how much effort you’re putting in (...) if you have not, on the level of your views,
devalued sensuality *forever*.

> Through not understanding the danger of it — you are still within it.

> There will be no wisdom arising on account of whatever endurance you undergo, because you do so while still acting from the point of view that sensual pleasures are valuable.

> It doesn’t matter whether you’re a monk or a lay person: if you want to practice the Dhamma, practically speaking, most of the work comes down to drying your mind from sensuality, it doesn’t come down to finding the perfect technique or reading the exact sutta that will make you enlightened.
> The reason why you’re not enlightened even after you have read all the Suttas, is not because you haven’t read them enough or you haven’t thought about them enough — it’s because your sticks are not dry enough and your views are not relinquished.

### Discerning disown the body

> If you want to uproot the dependence on the pleasure of the sense objects, you have to uproot the dependence on the pleasure of this body: its agreeability and your assumption of ownership, which results from not seeing it peripherally as a thing which endures there on its own, with its own thirsts. This disowning of the body can only be done on the level
of that correct peripheral recognition of what the body is. 

> It cannot be done on the level of observing the body with your senses; because then you are not actually observing the body, you are observing the sense objects which *require* the body.

> An eye cannot see itself. (...) You need to discern the body not on the level of the senses, but on the level of the framework of the world of the sense objects, and that is what will fully purify the relationship between you and the ‘indirect’ body that appears peripherally while you are experiencing sense objects.

> For as long as there are sense objects, the body, as the unity of the
sense organs, is peripheral to that. It’s always the background to the
domain of the sense objects, and that’s where you need to recognize it.

> It’s about understanding the six-sense base, the body as that thing which is there, that needs to be tamed on that level
of the peripheral.

> The less you engage with sense objects that are pulling you, the more the pressure that the body exerts over you will diminish, and the clearer you will see it on that level which is revealed through sense-restraint.

> If you want to stop chasing sense pleasures, you need to start practising mindfulness of the body *correctly*. (...) Instead of watching the sensations of the body, recognize the *idea* (dhamma) of it, as a real thing existing concurrently to your direct attention. And you can only learn to see that idea correctly, if you have been sufficiently practising sense restraint, guarding the sense doors,
moderating your eating, watchful(ness) and dwelling in solitude.

> When you have been sufficiently withdrawn in this way, you can disown the pressure and pull of those individual organs and start to see them as five individual animals, like the simile that the Buddha gave in SN 35.247. You can genuinely see them as wild animals that
need training, whereas those who are not withdrawn from sense objects (...) are
very much identified with them. They don’t see their sense organ as an independent entity which basically has its own life, desires and needs, which they need to tame and control. Each time there is a pull from
a sense object, then *they* are the ones that are pulled by sense objects. They don’t see anything in between.

> When one knows and sees the eye as not-self, the underlying tendencies are uprooted. When one knows and sees forms
as not-self, the underlying tendencies are uprooted. When one knows and sees like this, the underlying tendencies are uprooted. – SN 35.56

You could as well translate it as: "as not mine". The idea of "self" that the Buddha radically rejects is the ownership of anything you regard as yourself, as coming from yourself or as belonging to yourself. He never speaks in abstract concepts, but always in practical ways, always looking at how X *relates* to Y, always taking the dependence into account, what is based on what, what results in what, what stems from what. 
Practically speaking, by identifying yourself with anything that one usually identifies with and regards as himself, belonging to himself, coming from himself, you consider all of this to be *yours*. In this way identity automatically becomes or *is* ownership. 

This buddhist rejection of self in the sense of the rejection of any kind of identity and ownership (of the body and mind), is no rejection and is not in conflict with the idea of the self in Vedanta, where body and mind are not confused with the self, but where as the self is regarded only that which remains when everything is taken away that one could own. 

The Atman of the Vedanta is just the other side of the same coin of Buddhas Anatta, it includes the same rejection, the same overcoming, just looked at it like in an inverted image.
