> Nyanamoli: Restraint cannot cause you pain; it can only uncover the underlying pain of the desire that is already there.



## If external restraint has been achieved

> Nyanamoli: If you’re not devaluing sensuality and are still holding on to it as a valuable thing, not seeing the danger in it, then you are still within its domain even if you’re not engaging in it.

> When you do keep the virtue, practice sense restraint and patient endurance, you have to do it with the attitude of: ‘I will do this infinitely, forever. it doesn’t matter how long this lasts, I will have to endure it forever, and I won’t act out of it.’

> You might have already endured more than enough for wisdom to arise. But wisdom will not arise because, overall, you’re not relinquishing the *value* of sensuality.

> It doesn’t matter what you do, or how much effort you’re putting in (...) if you have not, on the level of your views,
devalued sensuality *forever*.

> Through not understanding the danger of it — you are still within it.

> There will be no wisdom arising on account of whatever endurance you undergo, because you do so while still acting from the point of view that sensual pleasures are valuable.
