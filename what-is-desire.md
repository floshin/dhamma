# Desire

The fulfillment of any desire does never help you to fulfill anything or to get anything. It does not add anything to you. 

If you need a other drink, another orgasm, another bite in that food, another smell, another touch, another sight - all of this does never create any form of fulfillment. 

It is always a *relief* that you seek. It doesn't give you anything, it *removes* something from you.

And this momentary relief that you feel when you fulfill any kind of desire, is not caused by the fulfillment of that desire, but in the short-term *absence* of desire following that fulfillment.

But it will return. And it will pressure you again and again, in a never-ending cycle.
