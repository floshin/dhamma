>  simply understanding what the path is about -- what is the work that one does in order to become an arahant. and because the possibility of arahantship is experientially seen -- it s not an empty imagining -- one actually knows in their bones what the work for that involves.

in understanding this, one understands the dhamma and its point -- which is the "awakening of the dhamma eye", i. e. becoming independent of others in interpreting the dhamma, becoming able to understand it experientially.

## Anatta

The Buddha said in his second discourse that things are anattā because they cannot be fully controlled to our satisfaction, not because they have no "lasting identity". The Suttas quite clearly state that things do endure, and not only as an "illusion" of the ignorant mind, but for the Buddha himself, and his ability to see that is praised:

    “Sir, the Buddha knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This too I remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the Buddha.”
—MN 123
