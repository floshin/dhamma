>  simply understanding what the path is about -- what is the work that one does in order to become an arahant. and because the possibility of arahantship is experientially seen -- it s not an empty imagining -- one actually knows in their bones what the work for that involves.

in understanding this, one understands the dhamma and its point -- which is the "awakening of the dhamma eye", i. e. becoming independent of others in interpreting the dhamma, becoming able to understand it experientially.

##  "Conditionality" (paṭiccasamuppāda) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1c7mobi/comment_on_nanavira_and_the_relevance_of_flux_to/

Anigha: 
"Conditionality" (paṭiccasamuppāda) is not about a process of momentary changes, an Abhidhammic idea that's utterly absent from the EBTs. It's about the fact that no matter how long any given thing lasts, there will always be something else that it depends on, the most fundamental being this fragile body remaining alive. That's why in MN 38, the Buddha discusses dependent origination in terms of the nutriment of the things that have arisen, and makes it clear that passion is abandoned by recognizing that without the nutriment, the thing standing upon it cannot remain. That is why things are anicca, dukkha, and anattā; no moment-to-moment process is mentioned.

In the same vein, SN 12.67 compares "conditionality" to two sticks standing upon each other, such that if you take away any of them, the other cannot stand. Again, no mention of "moments".

## Anatta


> Anigha: The Buddha said in his second discourse that things are anattā because they cannot be fully controlled to our satisfaction, not because they have no "lasting identity". The Suttas quite clearly state that things do endure, and not only as an "illusion" of the ignorant mind, but for the Buddha himself, and his ability to see that is praised:

    “Sir, the Buddha knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This too I remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the Buddha.”
—MN 123 


> Anigha: You're confusing identity in the sense of a thing remaining the same throughout time, and the sense of self which, as always explained in the Suttas, comes down to taking things as "mine". A thing remaining the same for however long does not force you to take it as "mine": even the most ignorant person in the world wouldn't automatically regard their neighbor's house as "mine" just because they see it as remaining the same for many years.

The lack of understanding of how something (everything, in the end) will be suddenly ripped away from you sometime in the future, even if its billions of years later, means not seeing the peril of taking it as "mine", and that's why appropriation and the sense of self take place even though they're entirely mistaken. The change that will eventually happen to every phenomenon does not care at all about how attached you were to it.

In fact, the erroneous sense of "mine" develops from familiarity, which requires things to last for a while.
