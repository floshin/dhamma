# Dhamma

Sanskrit: Dharma

How to define?
1. Totality of (true) principles all depending on each other?
2. Teaching of X (e.g. Buddha) assumed to be Nr. 1.
3. Phenomena, Things, States, Factors, Qualities, short: Dependencies?

> the Dhamma is apparent here-and-now, timeless, leading inwards, and to be experienced individually by the wise.

> Buddha: ‘I cannot make anyone enlightened. I just point the way, and they either choose to follow my instruction or not.’

> Buddha: Some succeed, while others fail. (...) What can I do about that?




Eightfold purification (MN 24 paraphrased):
> (1) Purification of virtue - for the sake of (2) purification of mind - for the sake of (3) purification of view - for the sake of (4) purification through overcoming doubt - for the sake of (5) purification of knowledge-and-vision of what is the path and what is not the path - for the sake of (6) purification of knowledge-and-vision of the practice - for the sake of (7) purification of knowledge-and-vision for the sake of (8) total Nibbāna by non-assumption.

> The renunciate life is led [...] for the sake of total Nibbāna by non-assumption. (MN 24)

→ The renunciate life begins by "purification of virtue". 

In other words:
Purifying virtue purifies the mind.  
Purifying the mind purifies the view (right view).   
Purifying view overcomes doubt (right resolve).   
Overcoming doubt reveals, makes known what is the path and what not.  
Clearly knowing the path makes clear what is the practice.  
Clearly knowing the practice leads to complete knowledge.  
Complete vision leads to total Nibbana by non-assumption.   

That said: One begins the training before seeing clearly where and why one is going, before knowing the path, before having any clarity about the practice. Only by purifying virtue, by keeping the precepts, the mind is purified and right view is developed. Only by right view the path and nature of the practice becomes clear, then one just has to continue walking the path and one will reach Nibbana eventually.

>  simply understanding what the path is about -- what is the work that one does in order to become an arahant. and because the possibility of arahantship is experientially seen -- it s not an empty imagining -- one actually knows in their bones what the work for that involves.

in understanding this, one understands the dhamma and its point -- which is the "awakening of the dhamma eye", i. e. becoming independent of others in interpreting the dhamma, becoming able to understand it experientially.

The Noble Eightfold Path

* right view
* right resolve/aspiration
* right speech
* right conduct
* right livelihood
* right effort
* right mindfulness
* right samadhi 

Buddha is said to have told Subhadda before his death:

> In whatsoever doctrine and discipline, Subhadda, the Ariyan Eightfold Path is not found, there is not found any man of true sainthood (...). But in that Doctrine and Discipline in which is found the Ariyan Eightfold Path, there are men of true sainthood.

##  "Conditionality" (paṭiccasamuppāda) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/HillsideHermitage/comments/1c7mobi/comment_on_nanavira_and_the_relevance_of_flux_to/

Anigha: 
"Conditionality" (paṭiccasamuppāda) is not about a process of momentary changes, an Abhidhammic idea that's utterly absent from the EBTs. It's about the fact that no matter how long any given thing lasts, there will always be something else that it depends on, the most fundamental being this fragile body remaining alive. That's why in MN 38, the Buddha discusses dependent origination in terms of the nutriment of the things that have arisen, and makes it clear that passion is abandoned by recognizing that without the nutriment, the thing standing upon it cannot remain. That is why things are anicca, dukkha, and anattā; no moment-to-moment process is mentioned.

In the same vein, SN 12.67 compares "conditionality" to two sticks standing upon each other, such that if you take away any of them, the other cannot stand. Again, no mention of "moments". 


## Samadhi

Outside of samādhi, the body does feel the pull of agreeable and disagreeable sense objects, but for one who fully understands the deathless with the mind (not a mystical state outside of the aggregates, but rather the ever-present possibility to not crave amidst what incites craving, i.e., "withstand the tide"), that's a non-issue, because the mind is where the whole mass of suffering exists. An agitated body is just an insignificant nuisance in comparison, and that's why an Arahant doesn't need to protect their samādhi anymore (MN 107, SN 16.5, SN 17.30).

For a noble one, who knows how direct their mind to the deathless or "cessation" with the mind, the body eventually follows along, i.e. jhānas (AN 9.33). The body itself (the six senses as a unitary whole, not a collection of sensations) ceases to experience the pull of the things that used to pull it while they're still present (SN 35.247, SN 35.97), and that relief results in a very physical joy, ease, "rapture", etc., which is just a byproduct and a further substantiation of the same mental understanding. This is always temporary, but abiding in it repeatedly is how a noble disciple's understanding of the deathless eventually reaches fulfillment, and samādhi becomes just a nice-to-have.

> Anigha: The Buddha said in his second discourse that things are anattā because they cannot be fully controlled to our satisfaction, not because they have no "lasting identity". The Suttas quite clearly state that things do endure, and not only as an "illusion" of the ignorant mind, but for the Buddha himself, and his ability to see that is praised:

    “Sir, the Buddha knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. He knows thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This too I remember as an incredible and amazing quality of the Buddha.”
—MN 123 


> Anigha: You're confusing identity in the sense of a thing remaining the same throughout time, and the sense of self which, as always explained in the Suttas, comes down to taking things as "mine". A thing remaining the same for however long does not force you to take it as "mine": even the most ignorant person in the world wouldn't automatically regard their neighbor's house as "mine" just because they see it as remaining the same for many years.

The lack of understanding of how something (everything, in the end) will be suddenly ripped away from you sometime in the future, even if its billions of years later, means not seeing the peril of taking it as "mine", and that's why appropriation and the sense of self take place even though they're entirely mistaken. The change that will eventually happen to every phenomenon does not care at all about how attached you were to it.

In fact, the erroneous sense of "mine" develops from familiarity, which requires things to last for a while.
