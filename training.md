> recognize that ordination is not for the sake of running away and *forgetting* about your problems but about *facing them* relentlessly on the internal level. - Bhante Anigha

## Moderate Eating

> Banthe Anigha: "Put aside any considerations of taste, either for gratification or avoidance, and choose what's most nutritious, easiest to prepare, and most affordable. From there, it would be a matter of standing your ground against the mind trying to either use the food for gratification or pressure you to doubt your choices and avoid things you know you didn't choose out of lust, just because they happen to be agreeable. Both entail falling from the context of sustaining the body to buy more time to practice and instead concerning yourself with how you feel."
