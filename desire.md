# Desire

What is desire?
* Desire vs. Need. It is always something you want or seem to want, sometimes even something that you seem to *need*. But a desire is *never* a need. One can have a desire for something that one *also* needs, but it is never the same. Your body may need to eat to survive and you may want to eat too; it can be on behalf of this need or it can be on behalf of something else, like delighting in taste, but the body needs it if you want it or not; and often you desire it even if in absence of any need. Thus desire is not need and need is not desire.

* Desire is an internal pressure to do something or get something, to experience or possess something, to be or to have something. 

* Desire cam either be fulfilled or it can be not fulfilled. One can give in to the pressure or one can not give in to the pressure and just endure it.

* The fulfillment of any desire does never help you to fulfill anything or to get anything. It does not add anything to you. If you need a other drink, another orgasm, another bite in that food, another smell, another touch, another sight - all of this does never create any form of fulfillment. It is always a *relief* that you seek. It doesn't give you anything, it *removes* something from you.
This momentary relief that you feel when you fulfill any kind of desire, is not caused by the fulfillment of that desire, but in the short-term *absence* of desire following that fulfillment.

* Desire that is fullfilled is nourished thereby and will always come back for more. And it will pressure you again and again, in a never-ending cycle.
