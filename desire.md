# Desire

Forms of desire:
* (Wholesome) Striving/Aspiring (???)
* (Unwholesame) Craving (tanhā)

Ajan Chah defines tanhā (craving) as
> desires conditioned by ignorance of the way things are.



> The eye delights in forms, takes delight in forms, rejoices in forms; the ear delights in sounds, takes delight in sounds, rejoices in sounds; the nose delights in odours, takes delight in odours, rejoices in odours; the
tongue delights in flavours, takes delight in flavours, rejoices in flavours; the body delights in touches, takes delight in touches, rejoices in touches; the mind
delights in ideas, takes delight in ideas, rejoices in ideas; (all) that has been
tamed by the Tathāgata, guarded, protected, and restrained, and he
teaches the Dhamma for its restraint. – MN 75

What is desire?
* Desire vs. Need. It is always something you want or seem to want, sometimes even something that you seem to *need*. But a desire is *never* a need. One can have a desire for something that one *also* needs, but it is never the same. Your body may need to eat to survive and you may want to eat too; it can be on behalf of this need or it can be on behalf of something else, like delighting in taste, but the body needs it if you want it or not; and often you desire it even if in absence of any need. Thus desire is not need and need is not desire.

* Desire is an internal pressure to do something or get something, to experience or possess something, to be or to have something. 

* Desire cam either be fulfilled or it can be not fulfilled. One can give in to the pressure or one can not give in to the pressure and just endure it.

* The fulfillment of any desire does never help you to fulfill anything or to get anything. It does not add anything to you. If you need a other drink, another orgasm, another bite in that food, another smell, another touch, another sight - all of this does never create any form of fulfillment. It is always a *relief* that you seek. It doesn't give you anything, it *removes* something from you.
This momentary relief that you feel when you fulfill any kind of desire, is not caused by the fulfillment of that desire, but in the short-term *absence* of desire following that fulfillment.

* Desire that is fullfilled is nourished thereby and will always come back for more. And it will pressure you again and again, in a never-ending cycle. 

* [include some aspects from the sense restraint why doc, then to this:]

> Nyanamoli (paraphrased): The addiction is not uprooted because of the relationship
between you and your body.

> (...) your body and senses are (the) basis from which you are pressured.

> Your dependence on the pleasures of the sense objects is determined by and dependent upon the pressure that your body exerts on your mind.

> Overcoming sensuality (...) is about taming that which pressures you, because of which you are not free.

> Sense restraint — not engaging in those sense objects that are inciting of lust — is the prerequisite for discerning the root of the problem.

> If you don’t engage with the pleasures that the senses are used to, their
dependence on them will cease.


## WHY do we desire?

* Why does a specific form that we see and consider to be beautiful invoke desire, e.g. to touch and to be intimate with it?
* If we couldn't be able to see it, we couldn't delight in its sight, but we could still delight in its touch, in feeling the shape of the form, the smoothness of the skin, the smell, the taste and the idea of it; seeing it or not the form would manifest in our mind.

* Why does this desire arise?

* A doctrine that holds any form of sensual desire or any act carried out on the basis of sensual desire (and e.g. considers it impossible to perform a sexual act without it) to be wrong, is thereby clearly an anti-natalist doctrine. We should have very good reason before making such a statement and hold such a view, before we recommend humanity to collectively stop procreation. → Thus, if there is any valuable reason for the desire to be, it shouldn't be condemned on principal reasons.
 
* Is it only due to biological factors, that are driving us to reproduce? Or is there more to it?
