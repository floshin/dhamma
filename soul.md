# On the Soul

> "Atman is an entity which knows the body, resides in the body, yet differs from it. God is an element which knows the world, resides in the world and yet differs from it. Brahman transcends both."
(Vinoba Bhave in the 21st Century)

> Vinoba: God is inferential Brahman. Atman is Brahman only."

> From the direct experience of Atman, we infer God.

Just as, from the direct experience of our breath, we infer air. 

The soul "is" just like our breath "is". It is eternal until it is not. Everything that has a beginning has an end. So our body, the embodiment of our soul, has its first breath and its last breath. Inbetween there is a constant cycle of breathing in and out, the breath is constantly renewing, our soul is eternal because it is eternally new and it only cannot die, because it is never seperated from the air, it is the air, just the air as it momentarily, actualises itself by sustaining a body. The breath seems to be in us, but actually we are in, within the breath and cannot be without the breath. God, like the air, is beyond us, and yet in us, immanent and transcendent.
