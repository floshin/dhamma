# On the Soul

> "Atman is an entity which knows the body, resides in the body, yet differs from it. God is an element which knows the world, resides in the world and yet differs from it. Brahman transcends both."
(Vinoba Bhave in the 21st Century)

> Vinoba: God is inferential Brahman. Atman is Brahman only."

> From the direct experience of Atman, we infer God.

Just as, from the direct experience of our breath, we infer air. 

The soul "is" just like our breath "is". It is eternal until it is not. Everything that has a beginning has an end. So our body, the embodiment of our soul, has its first breath and its last breath. Inbetween there is a constant cycle of breathing in and out, the breath is constantly renewing, our soul is eternal because it is eternally new and it only cannot die, because it is never seperated from the air, it is the air, just the air as it momentarily actualises itself by sustaining a body. The breath seems to be in us, but actually we are in, within the breath and cannot be without the breath. God, like the air, is beyond us, and yet in us, immanent and transcendent. 

The "individual reality" we therefore call "the Soul", the "universal reality" we call the "Spirit". 

> Vinoba: "The soul is the embodiment of potentiality".

> Since man is essentially the spirit, he is free to shape his destiny. He has the power to affect the course of societal processes and bend them to his will. Such is the power of the Soul. And since the Soul is a unity, that is, it is the same in every human being, Vinoba perceives the unity of all mankind. In this unity, there is no place for division, no place for discord. If division and discord exist, it is because of the misperception of the reality, the reality of oneness of the spirit which binds all human beings into an indivisible whole.

> Vinoba's theory of revolution emanates from the realisation of the unity of mankind. Given this unity and its perception, man must widen the horizons of his own self, the Atman. He says, "the mother experiences the joy of renunciation and sacrifices for the sake of her children and gets happiness thereby. Vinoba wants us to widen the area of family love to the whole village community on the basis of unity of Atman.

## Anatta 

> Anigha: the point of both this and the "container" description is to point towards seeing "with this, this is", which is the paṭiccasamuppāda/simultaneous dependence principle that is the only way out of the sense of self.
