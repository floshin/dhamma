# Virtue (Sila)

> Anigha: Craving (for or against things) is like a dog pulling on a leash — the pull will not be perceivable to the extent that you run with it. Suffering is like a subtle yet very foul odor, easily masked by pleasant fragrances. This means that, though ordinary people certainly experience suffering and craving pretty much perpetually, they stand no chance of discerning them until they at least abandon the things that cover them up (ceasing to internally delight in those things too, not just externally stopping them).

→ Discern suffering and craving by abandoning everything that covers them up; that means, in order to overcome craving and thereby suffering, one has to start by *revealing* the craving as much as possible and then enduring its pressure without acting out of it. 

One can reveal the craving and suffering it causes only by abandoning what covers them up; and what covers them up is sensuality, identification with and ownership of the body, sexuality, intoxication, indulgence and distraction. The precepts therefore contain abstaining from exactly these. Not because there is any moral fault in doing otherwise, but simply because abstaining from them is necessary, in a technical or methodical sense, in order to reveal the craving. 

> Anigha: Your own mind and its cravings will become apparent only when you firmly set up a fence around yourself and no longer do certain things that cause you to become scattered and lose perspective over what's happening internally, and these are the things that the precepts prevent you from doing.

> Julius Evola: In Buddhism, the elements of sīla, that is, of "right conduct," are considered purely as "instruments of the mind": it is not a question of "values" but of "instruments," instruments of a virtus, not in the moralistic sense but in the ancient sense of virile energy.

"Two aspects of sīla are essential to the training: right "performance" (caritta), and right "avoidance" (varitta)."

> Anigha: A mind with samādhi is a mind that is independent and self-contained, and doesn't need to pursue or deal with anything to be at ease—neither sensuality and things in the world, nor a meditation technique and experiences arising from it. It is a mind that is well established in the only reliable form of contentment: *the abandoning of needs, not their fulfillment*. And that's precisely what virtue very directly leads to.

→ Virtue leads to contentment through the abandonment of needs.

> Anigha: you can only begin to develop this higher understanding (the Right View) if you have purified your virtue first.

> Anigha: "(they) make compromises in their virtue and their awareness of uncomfortable truths"

> Anigha: "human existence is made for sensuality and reproduction. If you want liberation, you don't do what your birth is meant for."

> If you've discerned the true purpose of virtue, clinging to it becomes entirely redundant for maintaining it — just as clinging to the choice not to drink bleach is unnecessary if you fully understand what what it would do to you.
