# Non-Possession

Aparigraha or Asangraha

* If I do not possess this body, if it is not *mine*, if its senses are not mine, then the pressures by which they are pressuring me are not from me. And if they are not from me, but just pressure building up from "outside" (of me), then I can easily endure. "Ertrage und entsage".
