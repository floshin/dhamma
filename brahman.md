Internally Brahman is inconceivable, imperceptible and incorporeal.  
Externally Brahman is conceivable, perceptible and corporeal.  

Internally it is nirguna. Internally it is abstract.  
Externally it is saguna. Externally is is concrete.   

Saguna Brahma is "God". Nirguna Brahma is "Gottheit" (Meister Eckhart).

> Vinoba: "The Sun necessarily implies light, so *Satya* necessarily implies knowledge and where there is *Satya-jnana*, there cannot be grief. There is bound to be bliss. So *Brahman* is known as *Saccidananda*."

> Vinoba: "He is the purest essence of the things of the world."
