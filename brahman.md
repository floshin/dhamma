# On Brahman

> Vinoba: *Brahma Satyam. Satyam Brahma*.  
> *Brahma* is *Satya*, it is existence.   
> The nature of *Brahman* is *Satya*.  

> Vinoba: "There can be no definition of truth".

Internally Brahman is inconceivable, imperceptible and incorporeal.  
Externally Brahman is conceivable, perceptible and corporeal.  

Internally it is nirguna. Internally it is abstract.  
Externally it is saguna. Externally is is concrete.   

Saguna Brahma is "God". Nirguna Brahma is "Gottheit" (Meister Eckhart).  

Vinoba:
> "There is a cot of *nirguna* on which there is a bed of *saguna*, on which there is an idol with form. Such is the nature of Reality along with the cosmos."

> The world is pervaded by Brahman. The world is *sphurti* of Brahman. The word "Sphurti" suggests energy and movement and thus the world is energy incarnate endowed with a capacity for constant change. There is no status quo in the world. Like the Buddhists, Vinoba also holds that the world is changing every moment and takes diverse novel forms. Due to its ability to change, there is newness, freshness and eternal continuity in the world.

> This sphurti or urge is not something external to the *Brahman*, it is the same as sentient *Brahman* developing the form of sentience, Consciousness, self-consciousness and manifests itself in the human world, the social world.

> If the Brahman and the world are to be coherent in growth, if the manifestations of *Brahman* are ever to grow then there cannot be a place for violence. Non-violence will automatically be an inherent constituent, a formative part of this. No less, it should be the nature of life or *Jivan*.

> Vinoba: "The Sun necessarily implies light, so *Satya* necessarily implies knowledge and where there is *Satya-jnana*, there cannot be grief. There is bound to be bliss. So *Brahman* is known as *Saccidananda*."

> Vinoba: "He is the purest essence of the things of the world."


## On God or from Brahman to Ishvara

What Meister Eckhart calls Gott and the Gottheit beyond, in Vedanta is Ishvara and Brahman.

Vinoba: "God is an inferential Brahman".

> Brahman stands above this Ishvara and individual selves as a unifying Ultimate Reality. (...) God to him is one particular expression of *Brahman*, looked at from the human point of view.

> God is the totality of attributes.
> Mainly Truth (Satya), Love (Karuna?) and Compassion (Metta?).

> The values cherished by human beings are embodied in God.
> God is the embodiment of all wholesome, auspicious attributes. 

> Vinoba: "Where there is the end of cause-effect cycle, beyond which nothing can be imagined, which is beyond animate and inanimate, yet everything is included in that, that alone is the ultimate cause or 'Only *Sat*' God.  

(in this context, read the basic argument of Thomas von Aquin?)

God is immanent and transcendent. Brahman is neither immanent nor transcendent?
