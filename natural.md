# Natural

Is the spiritual training in opposition to or in accordance with nature?

These are two completely opposite perspectives. One sees "natural" as something positive, that is in accordance with the Dharma, for him following the Dharma is natural. The other sees natural as something negative, bound to the animal side in us, and for him following the Dharma is going against nature.

This comes down to the question:
* what is the nature of man?
* what ought to be considered as natural for men?


## Nature for the Cynics

The ancient cynics had this idea of living in accordance with nature as their primary maxime. A life in accordance with nature for them was a virtuous life. 

Their training was not, in any way, about getting rid of or withstanding anything that they considered as natural, but rather in getting rid of or withstanding what they considered as unnatural. 

They weren't against or didn't condemn what they deemed in harmony with (human) natural order, but they were against and did condemn wherever society or culture diverted from the natural order. 

They weren't counter-nature, they were counter-culture. Against a human civilisation that perverted the natural order. 

In following this goal, their training had many similarities to the training of the buddhistic or vedantic renunciant.

* They got rid of any external possessions as much as possible, only wearing their robe for basic decency, carrying the bare necessecities in their sack and begging for food, because it is unnatural to do otherwise. No other animal has a house full of things it considers its own or earns money for a living and why should it do so? It takes what it can get. 

* They trained themselves to endure the cold, the heat; they did not hide from nature, but exposed themselves to it, against the usual and habitual comfort of the society they were living in. Because it is unnatural to do otherwise. Just as a dog is requiring much less comfort, can endure the weather and can sleep on a hard floor, so they followed this example and lived accordingly.

* They also were against any form of beautification, just like the buddhists, because which other animal is running around with amulets and rings, paints its face to appear younger or more attractive? It is all unnatural and thus unvirtuous in the cynic philosophy.

* In the same way they also were against entertainment. For them it was all vain and unnatural theatre. Think of Diogenes, who demonstratively walked out of the theatre when everyone else was walking into it. Upon asked why he is doing so:
> I strive for this attitude in my entire lifestyle. 

* In these aspects, the lifestyle of the Cynics, at least externally, is similar to that of the renunciant. One cannot say that it is particularly "natural" to depend on constant comfort and suffer in lack of it, as this constant desire for more comfort is a particular trait of the *civilised* human. 

* But where they divert is in the fulfillment of the natural desires, such as hunger, thirst and sexual desire.
