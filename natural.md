These are two completely opposite perspectives. One sees "natural" as something positive, that is in accordance with the Dharma, for him following the Dharma is natural. The other sees natural as something negative, bound to the animal side in us, and for him following the Dharma is going against nature.

This comes down to what is the nature of man.
