# Existence

Terms:
* Sat (Sanskrit)
* ... (Pali)

> Anigha: Existence has conditions. Greed, aversion and delusion - craving. And the same conditions that lead you to exist, are the conditions that lead you to suffer.

> Anigha: Existence is determined by craving.

> Anigha (paraphrased): If you want to be free from suffering, you want to be free from craving. And if you free yourself from craving, you're freeing yourself from the conditions of existence.

> Anigha: You cannot go from existence to non-existence. The only thing you can do is *refine* the way you exist.
