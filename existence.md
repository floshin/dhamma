# Existence

Terms:
* Sat (Sanskrit)
* ... (Pali)

> Anigha: Existence has conditions. Greed, aversion and delusion - craving. And the same conditions that lead you to exist, are the conditions that lead you to suffer.

> Anigha: Existence is determined by craving.

> Anigha (paraphrased): If you want to be free from suffering, you want to be free from craving. And if you free yourself from craving, you're freeing yourself from the conditions of existence.

Existence is determined by craving and conditioned by craving. By overcoming craving, we would overcome conditional existence and instead reach unconditional existence. But unconditional existence is a contradiction. Conditional existence is dependent existence; while independent existence is the opposite of existence, is non-existence, because existence is defined by its dependency, whatever exists, that means whatever stands out in a contrast to something else, can only arise in dependence, exists in dependence, through dependence. 

**Question:**  
If the price of freedom from suffering is to overcome existence itself, if we can only not suffer by not existing, is this really worth striving for?  
Many would agree that suffering is inevitably linked to existence, that one will always suffer sooner or later and that the possibility of suffering is always there.  
But when you would let them choose either to continue this eternal cycle or to stop existing, I am sure that most would choose to continue, because they think that the value of existence and the experience of life itself outweighs both the potential and the actual suffering it contains.

## "Refining" Existence

> Anigha: You cannot go from existence to non-existence. The only thing you can do is *refine* the way you exist. 

> Anigha: You have no choice but to loose your being. But to undergo that suffering, that loss of all that you have appropriated, it's just a question of whether you do it as a *practice*, that would then free you from that entirely, that you would not take things up again, or if you just keep gaining and loosing, gaining and loosing indefinitely.
