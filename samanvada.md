* Vinobas Theory about the reality of the world.
* Vinobas

If you think or believe that in your particular culture, tradition or religion or in your book there is something, a truth, a value, or ideas which are not only relevant for you, but which are true and valuable for everyone, meant for everyone and should therefore be known by everyone; if you think in this way, then it is in your interest to share this truth, this value, these ideas with others who are not aware of them yet.  

And if you want to share these ideas from your particular culture, your tradition, your religion with others, based in a different culture, tradition and/or religion, then they are speaking a different language, are accustomed to different concepts, words, metaphors, allegories and so forth. Thus, in order to reach them you will use what *they* know in order to teach them what *you* know. 

In order to teach them, you will first have to learn about where they are coming from and what (if anything) may be lacking in their tradition, culture or religion. You will have to understand what about your tradition or doctrine is similar, different, identical, synonymous and so forth. Thus, even just in the interest of spreading your own ideas (which you will want if these ideas are as valuable and wholesome as you assume), it is almost obligatory to learn about the ideas of others.
