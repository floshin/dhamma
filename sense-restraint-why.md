# Why to restrain our Senses

When one at first comes into contact with the idea of sense restraint, it can be hard to understand why one should even try.

And if you don't know why, even if you try, it will be very hard to restrain anything. While, if the buddhist doctrine is correct, then when you really would understand the reason why you should restrain your senses, it wouldn't be hard at all. It would be easy, because the understanding would make it natural and necessary. 

From this follows that when it is hard for you to restrain your senses and if you don't really understand *why* you should, it should be the highest priority to understand more and more, why it should be done. Because struggling with it may be necessary and worthwile, but only complete understanding can lead to mastery.

> Nyanamoli: Any desire that arises in regard to anything available through the senses is at its root oppressing.

> When a desire arises, the automatic response is to give in to that pressure of desire. And why would you give in to the pressure of any desire? Because it’s unpleasant. If the pressure of the desire
were neutral or pleasant, you wouldn’t make any effort and spend time
trying to gain what your desire wants, because you would already be at
ease. [...] **When you are engaging in sensual desires, you do so in order to be free from the unpleasant pressure of that very desire.**

> Desire pressures you to act. But you don't *have* to act. / You always have a choice.

> The only reason you are engaged
with sensuality is because the pressure of sensual desire is unpleasant, and you don’t know any other escape from that pressure other than the temporary release through sensual indulgence.
