# Why to restrain our Senses

When one at first comes into contact with the idea of sense restraint, it can be hard to understand why one should even try.

And if you don't know why, even if you try, it will be very hard to restrain anything. While, if the buddhist doctrine is correct, then when you really would understand the reason why you should restrain your senses, it wouldn't be hard at all. It would be easy, because the understanding would make it natural and necessary. 

From this follows that when it is hard for you to restrain your senses and if you don't really understand *why* you should, it should be the highest priority to understand more and more, why it should be done. Because struggling with it may be necessary and worthwile, but only complete understanding can lead to mastery.

> Nyanamoli: Any desire that arises in regard to anything available through the senses is at its root oppressing.

> When a desire arises, the automatic response is to give in to that pressure of desire. And why would you give in to the pressure of any desire? Because it’s unpleasant. If the pressure of the desire
were neutral or pleasant, you wouldn’t make any effort and spend time
trying to gain what your desire wants, because you would already be at
ease. [...] **When you are engaging in sensual desires, you do so in order to be free from the unpleasant pressure of that very desire.**

> Desire pressures you to act. But you don't *have* to act. / You always have a choice.

> The only reason you are engaged
with sensuality is because the pressure of sensual desire is unpleasant, and you don’t know any other escape from that pressure other than the temporary release through sensual indulgence.

> The more dependent you are on running away from that pressure of sensual desire, the more pressure that desire will exert over you.

> If you want to free yourself from it, you have to first start restraining your senses, and refraining from making it worse
by giving in to that pressure of desire.

> through restraint, the painful nature of that desire in itself becomes apparent.

That means, in order for sense restraint to become easy, you have to fully understand why and see how sensuality enslaves you. But at the same time, only by practicing sense restraint regardless of your lack of understanding beyond a mere theoretical assumption, will this understanding develop, because by enduring the pressure you get aware of it and the enslaving nature of desire is revealed. 

And by revealing the enslaving nature of sensual desire, only by doing so, by becoming aware of it, can an actual desire for liberation arise.

> Nyanamoli: People are terrified of isolation. They can no longer escape what they have been running away from.

> Nyanamoli: As the Buddha described, all the effort that you put into trying to light a fire with wet sticks will go to waste, because you have not dried the sticks through living physically withdrawn from sensual pleasures, and internally abandoning the value you hold for sensual pleasures.

> Mentally abandoning sensuality is not simply about not thinking about it, it means *devaluing* it.

Two aspects of sense restraint:
* External: Living physically withdrawn from sensual pleasures.
* Internal: Mentally abandoning the value you hold for sensual pleasures.

Or: 
* Abandon Sensuality externally (physically) and internally (mentally).
  * External abandonment consists in physical withdrawing from sensual pleasures, not acting out of sensual pleasure and slowly removing any inclination towards it. 
  * Internal abandonment consists in mentally withdrawing from sensual pleasures, but as well as devaluing it, slowly removing any value for it.
 


> Withdrawal from sensuality, sustaining that mind withdrawn from sensuality — it’s not just doable, it’s what the practice is.
