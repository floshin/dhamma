# On Samya-Yoga


> Abhidheyam Parama Samyam. (Vinoba, Samya-Sutra)

Samya-Yoga comprises of seven fold equilibrium in human attitude -
A. To regard all ups and downs in life as equal and maintain one's composure
B. To understand that our soul is actionless but our body needs action
C. Equilibrium of mind
D. Excellence at work due to diligence
E. Attempts at forming an egalitarian society
F. Permanent Bliss - Union of self and God, which is known as Realisation - Advaita

Part E is part of social engineering in which Indian holy men, the Rishis, have worked over three rites.
*Yajna*, *Dana*, *Tapas*. 

> Yajna is human action for bringing equilibrium in world's divinely beneficial natural elements and forces (Ecology). Dana is human action for bringing equilibrium in human relationships through sharing every positive fate entrusted to us. Tapa is human action for bringing balanced growth in inward and outward faculties. This is India's way of harmonious living. 

Flosha: "Sacrifice is the Essence of Right Economy".

> Action performed with pure heart is free from any attachment. It is a sheer outpouring of Love that acts as a balm on others wounds.

> Purity of purpose totally erases the action. Action is reduced to ashes immediately.

> "True social service begins *after* self-realisation.

> Vinoba's philosophy of Samya Yoga leads him to *Samanvaya* (Concurrence). *Samanvaya* teaches one to turn inwards.

> "This turn inwards is indeed revolutionary. To shed off the Self - as ego - and to realiize self as spirit, this whole experience is incomparably novel and noble. This is real Sannyas, grand and sacred.

> A human being is the central of a mutually helpful universal order which is called *Sristhi Yajna* - the secrifice of creational interdependence. Wise men of the world must unite to guide and prepare all humans to work for this *Vedanta* in action. Therefore freedom is a must. Anarchism is preferable to authoritarianism. Vinoba declared that all living beings are one, all are equal, all are blessed to work to their best capacities for someone else's benefit, and all deserve a scope to express their Divine nature in an open atmosphere of benevolence.

> Vinoba called for a society where nobody shall rule and nobody shall exploit. The spirit of independence and self-discipline are the first and foremost tenets of Gandhi-Vinoba's method of education. Education should be nothing but the enfoldment of the unique inner potentialities vested in each human and this is impossible without an atmosphere of care-taking on the part of the *Guru*.

> Today's social system is unnatural because it is based on differentiation. Therefore a true student of Gandhian Thought should have the guts to revolt against this.

> Revolutionary spirit should be always independent, and awakened. With self-sacrificing boldness it should vouch that the state power and military dominance shall keep out of the independent and co-operative self-government of local republics.

> In the ninth chapter of the Gita verse no. 11 says that "men undervalue God in the human form". Vinoba's interpretation of this verse is that *Yogi* and *Sannyasi* stand for diametrically opposite approaches to life. But Vinoba showed that since both have realized the infinite, their value is equalized.

(associate Sannyasi with Shramana? Buddhist Bhikkhus and Yogi with Sufis?)

> [Vinoba] synthesized the concept of individual betterment and betterment of all, in the society. The two are mirrors set against one another and the betterment of one automatically shines in the other.

> Another dichotomy he has resolved artistically is that between isolation, introspection and of being surrounded by crowd - *Ekant* and *Lokant*.

(and how? Nothing is written there)

Is an act worldly or spiritual? Vinoba explains that all spirituality is nothing if it does not cleanse our worldly behavior. Where do you see sinner and *Sadhu* as equal? Of course at the inner light, a sinner once transformed can never again fall back to his bad habits so no one is condemnable. The flame of conscience is to be lighted by educating lovingly.

The seventeenth and eighteenth chapters of the Bhagavad Gita mention nine topics where *Lok-Sangraha* leads to light the path.
I. The field of Faith
II. The field of Food - Consumption
III. The field of Yajna - Ecological concern.
IV. The field of Dana - Social concern.
V. The field of Tapa - Bodily concern.
VI. The field of surrender.
VII. The field of work - Action, behavior.
VIII. The field of knowledge.
IX. The field of the agent of action - the human being.

> *Sumati Kumati Sabake Ura Basahin* - Good and Evil reside in every heart - select the virtuous, the best and forget the rest that is all one can do.

> Vinoba felt that his whole philosophy of Samya-Yoga, i.e. liberty, equality, fraternity and all pervasive justice is incorporated into Sarvodaya's constructive program. Vinoba hiimself summarised his idea of a utopian heaven on earth in three words - Truth, Non-violence and Compassion.

> Gita (paraphrased): There is no happiness without peace. There is no peace without self-sacrifice. There is no self-sacrifice without a wise sense of appropriation. And there is no sense of equality or brotherhood without developing the quality of self-restraint.

> Even in cities, small all-inclusive cooperation can be worked out through Municipal Council, where 1000 or less families can build up a "face to face fidelity and loyalty". Thus Vinoba has floated around an idea with an ideal. "Ideas have no fences. The have no boundaries. Language, religion, senses, nationalism and every other barricade is transgressed by ideas. Ideas have an entry into every noble heart inspiring individuals, capturing his/her imagination, transforming him and making him angelic in performance.
