# Robes

18.02.2026. I have found that the ideal measurements for the upper robe in the - assumed to be - most ancient and simple style (when the robe came closer to the cynics philosopher coat), can be found by standing straight, feet together, arms and fingers raised horizontally to the side. 
* The width of the robe should equal or slightly exceed the width of the arms and fingers, so that the wearer can hold his entire robe at his fingertips with the arms held straight to the side. 
* The length of the robe should equal the shoulder height, so that when held at the fingertips in the before-mentioned position behind the back, it is nearly on the floor.

The skirt should have about the same width, but be smaller in length. Some of the length is always reduced as it has to be secured by folding it a few times at the top, and the final skirt is not meant to reach the floor, but roughly end about in the middle of the calves. Therefore a good measurement may be: From the belly button to the floor. When rolled from here it may have the correct length.
