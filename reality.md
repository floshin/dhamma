# On Reality

Real is was is what is realised.  
"Unreal" is what is (yet) unrealised.   

Wirklich ist was sich in Verwirklichung befindet.   
Unwirklich ist, was (noch) nicht verwirklicht ist.  

Shankara: *Vivaratavâda*  
Ramanuja: *Parinamavada*.  

Vinoba (paraphrased): The world is not *Vivarta* of Brahman, it is *Parinama* of Brahman.

Ramanuja: "Kanchana Kamkanavat Parinama."  
Vinoba says: "Kanchana Kankanavat Vivartah".  

> The vedantins tried to explain the (...) relation of one and many with their different theories of causation. Samkara called it *Vivaratavâda* while Ramanuja called it *Parinamavada*. Vinoba refutes both and synthesises both.  
> The rope-snake example given by Samkara, he refutes by saying, "If the rope does not have the nature of a snake, we may try thousands of times but we will not see the snake in it. If *Brahman* does not share the nature of the world or vice versa, *Brahman* can never be seen as the world. So the world is not *Vivarta* of *Brahman*. It is *Parinama* of *Brahman*." Thus he changes Samkara's example of *Rajju Sarpavat Vivartato Rajju Sarpavat Parinama*.  
> He also refutes Ramanuja's example of *Kancana Kamkanavat Parinama*. According to Vinoba, only gold has real value while the bangle has no value at all for a Goldsmith. In the same manner the world is only an 'illusion' from one point of view. Between the two, namely, *Brahman* and the world, only *Brahman* is real. Thus, it will be seen that why Vinoba names it *Kanchana Kankanavat Vivartah*."

> According to Vinoba, the world is neither *mithya* as Shankara thinks nor real as Ramanuja believes. So if one runs away from the world calling it *maya* and the other runs after it considering it to be real, both are away from truth. "One is afraid of the rope-snake and the other beats it considering it to be real. In essence both the actions amount to the same thing."

> Vinoba maintains that the difference between Shankara's so called illusionism and his theory of vibrant manifestation (sphurtih) is only the difference in the presentation of one and the same truth. The superstructure of every illusion is founded on something real and positive. One has to dispel the mist of ignorance and penetrate through the appearance to reach the Reality of that appearance.

> For him, the world is a vibrant manifestation of *Brahman* which inspires in him a worshipful attitude or rouses in him the intense desire to serve. So *Brahman* is vibrating as *jagat* is real. The vibrant *Brahman* allows room for social reality. Thus, there is a place for men and animals, there is a place for service to humanity. The vibrations are changing, hence Buddha's doctrine of change (*Ksanikavada*) and continuity (*sanatanam*) makes its appearance in his metaphysics. The world is vibrant manifestation. Therefore, like vibrations, everything is changing.

> Vinoba seems to advocate the doctrine that by learning men continues to change every moment. (...) The philosophical idealism of Vedanta would be useless if it only builds castles in the air. Vinoba's idealism has its roots in the earth. It is practical.
> It not only aims at changing the hearts of men but also their physical conditions through social action. The constructive programme of Sarvodaya is based on this doctrine. Idealism is necessary because realism and pragmatism are children born of it and it shows the direction of progress.
